## Description

REDUX is the core habilite developed on this project. Learning about the store, reducers, actions and working with it on mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps was fundamental. Redux looks like a lot to work with, but once the tools are organized it feels like you have super powers over the props, its an amazing framework to manipulate medium to big applications.
